# Vortex: Efficient Geo-Distributed Task Scheduling

This repository contains the source code for the paper:

> **Vortex: Efficient Geo-Distributed Task Scheduling with Spatio-Temporal Resource Awareness and Data Gravity Optimization**

**Vortex** addresses key challenges in existing schedulers by integrating spatio-temporal resource modeling, HGNN-based job execution time (JET) prediction, physics-inspired data gravity optimization, and multi-objective scheduling.
